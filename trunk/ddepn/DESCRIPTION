Description: Given a matrix of reverse-phase-protein-array timecourse data, containing one or more experimental measurements for the signalling patterns among proteins in cells, the package attempts to model the time-dependent propagation of active and passive states depending on a network. The most likely network structure given the data is reconstructed.
